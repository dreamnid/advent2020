# Day 14

1st answer got screwed over as didn't realize the offset for parsing the mask string was off by one. 
Apparently, you'll eventually need to wait 5 minutes if you tried too many times. I did get the right answer, but didn't noticed the answer didn't copy in the clipboard correctly which triggered the 5 minute wait ugh!
